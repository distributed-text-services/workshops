## Talks

### Introducing the VedaWeb APIs by **Francisco Mondaca**

Cologne Center of eHumanities, University of Cologne

VedaWeb (vedaweb.uni-koeln.de) is a web-based, open-access platform for linguistic research on Old Indic texts. It provides access to texts and dictionaries through a web application as also APIs for direct access to data encoded in TEI-XML. The focus of this presentation is to show the structure of these APIs and to discuss the potential implementation of DTS in this project.

## Venue

The meeting will take place at the University of Hamburg, Ãœberseering 35, 22297 Hamburg
