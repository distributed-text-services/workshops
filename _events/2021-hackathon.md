title: DTS Hackathon
---

The first DTS hackathon is organised by the DTS community and generously funded by the [dhCenter UNIL-EPFL](https://dhcenter-unil-epfl.com/) and the [Ã‰cole Nationale des Chartes](http://www.chartes.psl.eu/). The **goal** of this hackathon is to raise awareness about the [DTS specifications](https://w3id.org/dts), encourage their use and, ultimately, to improve the ecosystem of datasets and tools around DTS.

## Format

The hackathon will take place fully online between **27 September - 8 October 2021**.

We propose two types of hacks:
1. **data hacks**, aimed at exposing new or already existing textual resources via a DTS-compliant API with the goal of enlarging the variety of domains, languages and periods covered by DTS. Participants proposing a data hack *may* be affiliated with the institution owning the data, but this is not strictly necessary (e.g. in case of open data).
2. **tool hacks**, aimed at enlarging the offer of DTS-compatible tools by extending existing software or developing new ones. Ideas for tool hacks include:
- development of DTS client libraries in any programming language (e.g., Go, Java, Ruby);
- development of generic viewers for DTS texts collections;
- extending existing annotation tools (e.g. [Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/), [INCEpTION](https://inception-project.github.io/)) to support DTS as a way of importing TEI documents to annotate;
- adding integration with tools/libraries that perform linguistic and/or semantic enrichment of textual data such as [NLTK](http://nltk.org/) , [CLTK](http://cltk.org/) or [DHTK](https://dhtk.unil.ch/);
- integration with digital editing tools such as collation tools (e.g., [CollateX](https://collatex.net/)) or publication tools (e.g., [EFES](https://github.com/EpiDoc/EFES), [ediarum](https://www.ediarum.org/))

## Prizes

The contributions developed during the hackathon will be evaluated by an international jury which will award prizes to winners in the following categories: 
1. **best tool I** (limited to tools that consume DTS-ready corpora, where consumption means enrichment, annotation, collation, etc.)
2. **best tool II** (limited to tools for the publication of DTS-compliant corpora);
3. **largest DTS corpus**
4. **most inclusive DTS corpus** (i.e. a corpus of texts whose language, time period or genre is currently underrepresented in the [DTS offer](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications#reference-implementations)).

(Prizes will have an individual value in the range of 300-400 CHF).

## Registration
