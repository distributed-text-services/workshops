title: DTS Hackathon
---

The first DTS hackathon is organised by the DTS community and generously funded by the [dhCenter UNIL-EPFL](https://dhcenter-unil-epfl.com/) and the [École Nationale des Chartes](http://www.chartes.psl.eu/). The **goal** of this hackathon is to raise awareness about the [DTS specifications](https://w3id.org/dts), encourage their use and, ultimately, to improve the ecosystem of datasets and tools around DTS. More information on DTS in the form of presentations can be found [here](https://github.com/distributed-text-services/presentations).

## Format

The hackathon will take place fully online between **27 September - 8 October 2021**.

We propose two types of hacks:
1. **data hacks**, aimed at exposing new or already existing textual resources via a DTS-compliant API with the goal of enlarging the variety of domains, languages and periods covered by DTS. Participants proposing a data hack *may* be affiliated with the institution owning the data, but this is not strictly necessary (e.g. in case of open data).
2. **tool hacks**, aimed at enlarging the offer of DTS-compatible tools by extending existing software or developing new ones. Ideas for tool hacks include:
- development of DTS client libraries in any programming language (e.g., Javascript, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, etc.);
- development of generic viewers for DTS texts collections;
- extending existing annotation tools (e.g. [Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/), [INCEpTION](https://inception-project.github.io/)) to support DTS as a way of importing TEI documents to annotate;
- adding integration with tools/libraries that perform linguistic and/or semantic enrichment of textual data such as [NLTK](http://nltk.org/) , [CLTK](http://cltk.org/) or [DHTK](https://dhtk.unil.ch/);
- integration with digital editing tools such as collation tools (e.g., [CollateX](https://collatex.net/)) or publication tools (e.g., [eXistDB](http://exist-db.org/) / [TEI Publisher](https://teipublisher.com/), [EFES](https://github.com/EpiDoc/EFES), [ediarum](https://www.ediarum.org/))

As far as code licensing is concerned, anything produced by hackathon participants is property of its author(s), yet it must be made available to the community under an open license (including non-commercial licenses) by the end of the hackathon. 

## Prizes

The contributions developed during the hackathon will be evaluated by an international jury which will award prizes to winners in the following categories: 
1. **best tool I** (limited to tools that consume DTS-ready corpora, where consumption means enrichment, annotation, collation, etc.)
2. **best tool II** (limited to tools for the publication of DTS-compliant corpora);
3. **largest DTS corpus**
4. **most inclusive DTS corpus** (i.e. a corpus of texts whose language, time period or genre is currently underrepresented in the [DTS offer](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications#reference-implementations)).

Category winners will be awarded a prize of their choice between the two following options:
1. One [Remarkable2 e-ink reader](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2)
2. One [Transkribus ScanTent](https://readcoop.eu/scantent/) + one [SanDisk portable SSD drive (1TB)](https://www.galaxus.ch/it/s1/product/sandisk-portable-ssd-2000gb-ssd-esterne-14967106)
