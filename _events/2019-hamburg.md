The workshop "Texts and APIs", funded by the *Procope Programme* of the French Ambassies in Germany and Switzerland, is composed of three different moments :

- Presentation of the Distributed Text Services and its applicability to corpora
- A round-table and discussions about what DTS needs to be better; or what we can do to support it more
- A hands-on workshop for people to try to build services around their data

Participation is open and free, but you will need to register here: <https://forms.gle/89wbTBuZnLk5ecFz9> (registration closes July 1).

## Talks


### **Thibault Clérice**, *Introduction to the workshop and to the DTS API*

[École nationale des chartes](http://www.chartes.psl.eu/)

### **Matteo Romanello**, *DTS & Resolution Services for Text URIs*

[DHLAB, EPFL](http://dhlab.epfl.ch)

### **Vincent Jolivet et Julien Pilla**, *Corpora at the École des Chartes*

[École nationale des chartes](http://www.chartes.psl.eu/)

### **Juan Garcés**, *Digital collections and APIs: some case scenarios (title TBC)*

[Saxon State and University Library Dresden (SLUB)](https://www.slub-dresden.de/en/homepage/)

### **Thomas Lebarbé**, *Title TBC*

[Consortium Cahier](https://cahier.hypotheses.org/)

### **P. Y. Buard**, *Publishing tools: DTS and MaX  (title TBC)*

### **Tobias Schweizer**, *The Bernoulli-Euler Online Platform (BEOL) and its RESTful API*

[Digital Humanities Lab](https://dhlab.philhist.unibas.ch/), University of Basel


The project [Bernoulli-Euler Online (BEOL)](https://dhlab.philhist.unibas.ch/en/home/) integrates several edition projects relating to the Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler into one platform available on the web, offering a multilayer access to the user (facsimiles, transcriptions, critical texts, translations, indices, and commentaries).

BEOL is implemented within [Knora](https://knora.org), a generic system based on RDF to store and work with humanities data. Knora offers a RESTful API that can be used to access BEOL's contents, including the edited texts.

### **Ernest Suyver**, *Brill Scholarly Editions*

Brill

In the context of DTS, Brill develops the Scaife Viewer into a generic open source publication platform; publication being one step in a larger process of content processing and distribution. (https://dh.brill.com/scholarlyeditions/)

### **Francisco Mondaca**, *Introducing the VedaWeb APIs*

[Cologne Center of eHumanities](https://cceh.uni-koeln.de/), University of Cologne

[VedaWeb](http://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de) is a web-based, open-access platform for linguistic research on Old Indic texts. It provides access to texts and dictionaries through a web application as also APIs for direct access to data encoded in TEI-XML. The focus of this presentation is to show the structure of these APIs and to discuss the potential implementation of DTS in this project.

### **Matt Munson**, *CTS to DTS in the 'Formulae - Litterae - Chartae' Project*

[Formulae - Litterae - Chartae Langzeitvorhaben](https://www.formulae.uni-hamburg.de/), Universität Hamburg

The "Formulae - Litterae - Chartae" project has developed its [corpus](https://github.com/Formulae-Litterae-Chartae/formulae-open) and [reading environment](https://werkstatt.formulae.uni-hamburg.de/) based on the current version of the CapiTainS tool suite and, especially, MyCapytain version 2.0, which is an implementation of the Canonical Text Services API. As CapiTainS moves toward the more general DTS standard, our project is planning to make both its corpus and its tools compatible with this new standard. This talk will reflect on the reasons for this change and the changes we will make to our corpus to fully embrace this new standard.

### **Pietro Luzzo**, *The DTS implementation for  Beta maṣāḥǝft*

[Hiob Ludolf Centre for Ethiopian and Eritrean Studies](https://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/en/ethiostudies.html), Universität Hamburg

Beta maṣāḥǝft is a long-term project funded under survey of the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Hamburg from 2016–2040. To achieve its aims of creating a virtual research environment that shall manage complex data related to the predominantly Christian manuscript tradition of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Highlands, the project has implemented DTS. The API https://betamasaheft.eu/api/dts serves all the available texts as editions or transcriptions of manuscripts, using dts:extensions to achieve a non hierarchical structuring of the corpus.

### **Stefan Dumont** *Texts and APIs in digital editions of correspondence and diaries*

[Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften](http://www.bbaw.de/telota/projekte/correspsearch-briefeditionen-vernetzen)

The meeting will take place at the University of Hamburg, Überseering 35, 22297 Hamburg
