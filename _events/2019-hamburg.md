### The DTS implementation for  Beta maṣāḥǝft **Pietro Luzzo**
Hiob Ludolf Centre for Ethiopian and Eritrean Studies, Universität Hamburg

Beta maṣāḥǝft is a long-term project funded under survey of the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Hamburg from 2016–2040. To achieve its aims of creating a virtual research environment that shall manage complex data related to the predominantly Christian manuscript tradition of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Highlands, the project has implemented DTS. The API https://betamasaheft.eu/api/dts serves all the available texts as editions or transcriptions of manuscripts, using dts:extensions to achieve a non hierarchical structuring of the corpus.

### Introducing the VedaWeb APIs by **Francisco Mondaca**

Cologne Center of eHumanities, University of Cologne

VedaWeb (vedaweb.uni-koeln.de) is a web-based, open-access platform for linguistic research on Old Indic texts. It provides access to texts and dictionaries through a web application as also APIs for direct access to data encoded in TEI-XML. The focus of this presentation is to show the structure of these APIs and to discuss the potential implementation of DTS in this project.
