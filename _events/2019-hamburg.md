## Talks


### **Thibault Clérice**


### **Vincent Jolivet**


### **Juan Garcés**, *Digital collections and APIs: some case scenarios (title TBC)*

[Saxon State and University Library Dresden (SLUB)](https://www.slub-dresden.de/en/homepage/)


### **Thomas Lebarbé** (Consortium Cahiers)

### **Stefan Dumont** *Texts and APIs in digital editions of correspondence and diaries*

[Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften](http://www.bbaw.de/telota/projekte/correspsearch-briefeditionen-vernetzen)


### **Pietro Luzzo**, *The DTS implementation for  Beta maṣāḥǝft*

[Hiob Ludolf Centre for Ethiopian and Eritrean Studies](https://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/en/ethiostudies.html), Universität Hamburg

Beta maṣāḥǝft is a long-term project funded under survey of the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Hamburg from 2016–2040. To achieve its aims of creating a virtual research environment that shall manage complex data related to the predominantly Christian manuscript tradition of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Highlands, the project has implemented DTS. The API https://betamasaheft.eu/api/dts serves all the available texts as editions or transcriptions of manuscripts, using dts:extensions to achieve a non hierarchical structuring of the corpus.

### **Francisco Mondaca**, *Introducing the VedaWeb APIs*

Cologne Center of eHumanities, University of Cologne

[VedaWeb](http://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de) is a web-based, open-access platform for linguistic research on Old Indic texts. It provides access to texts and dictionaries through a web application as also APIs for direct access to data encoded in TEI-XML. The focus of this presentation is to show the structure of these APIs and to discuss the potential implementation of DTS in this project.

### **Matt Munson**


### **Julien Pilla**


### **Matteo Romanello**, * DTS & Resolution Services for Text URIs*

[DHLAB, EPFL](http://dhlab.epfl.ch)

### **---**


### **Tobias Schweizer**, *The Bernoulli-Euler Online Platform (BEOL) and its RESTful API*

[Digital Humanities Lab](https://dhlab.philhist.unibas.ch/), University of Basel


The project [Bernoulli-Euler Online (BEOL)](https://dhlab.philhist.unibas.ch/en/home/) integrates several edition projects relating to the Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler into one platform available on the web, offering a multilayer access to the user (facsimiles, transcriptions, critical texts, translations, indices, and commentaries).

BEOL is implemented within [Knora](https://knora.org), a generic system based on RDF to store and work with humanities data. Knora offers a RESTful API that can be used to access BEOL's contents, including the edited texts.

### **Ernest Suyver**, *Brill Scholarly Editions*
Brill

In the context of DTS, Brill develops the Scaife Viewer into a generic open source publication platform; publication being one step in a larger process of content processing and distribution. (https://dh.brill.com/scholarlyeditions/)

The meeting will take place at the University of Hamburg, Überseering 35, 22297 Hamburg
